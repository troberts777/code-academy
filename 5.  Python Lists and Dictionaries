Introduction to Lists
Lists are a datatype you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information as a sequence under a single variable
name. (Datatypes you’ve already learned about include strings, numbers, and booleans.)

You can assign items to a list with an expression of the form

list_name = [item_1, item_2]
with the items in between brackets. A list can also be empty: empty_list = [].

Lists are very similar to strings, but there are a few key differences.

Instructions
1.
The list zoo_animals has three items (check them out on line 1). Go ahead and add a fourth! Just enter the name of your favorite
animal (as a "string") on line 1, after the final comma but before the closing ].
"""
zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", ];
# One animal is missing!

if len(zoo_animals) > 3:
  print "The first animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[0]
  print "The second animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[1]
  print "The third animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[2]
  print "The fourth animal at the zoo is the " + zoo_animals[3]
  
  
  
#2/14
"""
Access by Index
You can access an individual item on the list by its index. An index is like an address that identifies the item’s place in the 
list. The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this: list_name[index].

List indices begin with 0, not 1! You access the first item in a list like this: list_name[0]. The second item in a list is at
index 1: list_name[1]. Computer scientists love to start counting from zero.

Instructions
1.
Write a statement that prints the result of adding the second and fourth items of the list. Make sure to access the list by index!
"""
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]

print "Adding the numbers at indices 0 and 2..."
print numbers[0] + numbers[2]
print "Adding the numbers at indices 1 and 3..."
# Your code here!
print numbers[1] + numbers[3]


#3/14
"""
New Neighbors
A list index behaves like any other variable name! It can be used to access as well as assign values.

You saw how to access a list index like this:

zoo_animals[0]
# Gets the value "pangolin"
You can see how assignment works on line 5:

zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"
# Changes "sloth" to "hyena"
Instructions
1.
Write an assignment statement that will replace the item that currently holds the value "tiger" with another animal (as a string).
It can be any animal you like.
"""
zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "tiger"]
# Last night our zoo's sloth brutally attacked 
# the poor tiger and ate it whole.

# The ferocious sloth has been replaced by a friendly hyena.
zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"

# What shall fill the void left by our dear departed tiger?
# Your code here!
zoo_animals[3] = "lion"

print zoo_animals

"""
Late Arrivals & List Length
A list doesn’t have to have a fixed length. You can add items to the end of a list any time you like!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
letters.append('d')
print len(letters)
print letters
In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
Then, we add the string 'd' to the end of the letters list.
Next, we print out 4, the length of the letters list.
Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
Instructions
1.
On lines 5, 6, and 7, append three more items to the suitcase list, just like the second line of the example above. (Maybe bring a
bathing suit?)

Then, set list_length equal to the length of the suitcase list.
"""
suitcase = [] 
suitcase.append("sunglasses")

# Your code here!
suitcase.append("shirt")
suitcase.append("pants")
suitcase.append("shoes")

list_length = len(suitcase) # Set this to the length of suitcase

print "There are %d items in the suitcase." % (list_length)
print suitcase


#5/14
"""
List Slicing
Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list. Consider the following code:

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
slice = letters[1:3]
print slice
print letters
What is this code doing?

First, we create a list called letters.

Then, we take a subsection of the list and store it in the slice list. We do this by defining the indices we want to include after 
the name of the list: letters[1:3]. In Python, when we specify a portion of a list in this manner, we include the element with the
first index, 1, but we exclude the element with the second index, 3.

Next, we print out slice, which will print ['b','c']. Remember, in Python indices always start at 0, so the 1 element is actually b.

Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], notice that we did not modify the original letters list.

Instructions
1.
On line 7, create a list called middle containing only the two middle items from suitcase.

On line 10, create a list called last made up only of the last two items from suitcase.
"""
suitcase = ["sunglasses", "hat", "passport", "laptop", "suit", "shoes"]

print suitcase
print

# slice the list
# The first and second items (index zero and one)
first = suitcase[0:2]

# Third and fourth items (index two and three)
middle = suitcase[2:4]

# The last two items (index four and five)
last = suitcase[4:6]

print first
print middle
print last


#6/14
"""
Slicing Lists and Strings
You can slice a string exactly like a list! In fact, you can think of strings as lists of characters: each character is a sequential
item in the list, starting from index 0.

my_list[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
my_list[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items
If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn’t have to be included.

Instructions
1.
Assign to dog a slice of animals from index 3 up until but not including index 6.

Assign to frog a slice of animals from index 6 until the end of the string.
"""
animals = "catdogfrog"

print animals
# The first three characters of animals
cat = animals[:3]

# The fourth through sixth characters
dog = animals[3:6]

# From the seventh character to the end
frog = animals[6:]

print cat
print dog
print frog


#7/14
"""
Maintaining Order
Sometimes you need to search for an item in a list.

animals = ["ant", "bat", "cat"]
print animals.index("bat")
First, we create a list called animals with three strings.
Then, we print the first index that contains the string "bat", which will print 1.
We can also insert items into a list.

animals.insert(1, "dog")
print animals
We insert "dog" at index 1, which moves everything down by 1.
We print out ["ant", "dog", "bat", "cat"]
Instructions
1.
Use the .index(item) function to find the index of "duck". Assign that result to a variable called duck_index.

Then .insert(index, item) the string "cobra" at that index.
"""
animals = ["aardvark", "badger", "duck", "emu", "fennec fox"]
print animals


duck_index = animals.index("duck")# Use index() to find "duck"

# Your code here!
animals.insert(duck_index,"cobra")

print animals # Observe what prints after the insert operation


#8/14
"""
For One and All
If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop. If you’ve learned about for loops in JavaScript, 
pay close attention! They’re different in Python.

for variable in list_name:
  # Do stuff!
A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.

Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code
that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

Instructions
1.
Write a statement in the indented part of the for-loop that prints a number equal to 2 * number for every list item.
"""
my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
  # Your code here
  print 2 * number

"""
More with 'for'
If your list is a jumbled mess, you may need to sort() it.

animals = ["cat", "ant", "bat"]
animals.sort()

for animal in animals:
  print animal
First, we create a list called animals with three strings. The strings are not in alphabetical order.
Then, we sort animals into alphabetical order. Note that .sort() modifies the list rather than returning a new list.
Then, for each item in animals, we print that item out as "ant", "bat", "cat" on their own line each.
Instructions
1.
Write a for-loop that iterates over start_list and .append()s each number squared (x ** 2) to square_list.

Then sort square_list!

start_list = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
start_list.sort()  # lets sort this mess

  square_list.append(number ** 2)
square_list.sort()

print square_list


#10/14
"""
This Next Part is Key
A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or 
number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:

d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}
This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.

Dictionaries are great for things like phone books (pairing a name with a phone number), login pages (pairing an e-mail address
with a username), and more!

Instructions
1.
Print the values stored under the 'Sloth' and 'Burmese Python' keys. Accessing dictionary values by key is just like accessing
list values by index:

residents['Puffin']# Gets the value 104
Check the Hint if you need help!
"""
# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

# Your code here!
print "Cage # " + str(residents['Sloth'])
print residents['Burmese Python']


#11/14
"""
New Entries
Like Lists, Dictionaries are mutable. This means they can be changed after they are created. One advantage of this is that 
we can add new key/value pairs to the dictionary after it is created like so:

dict_name[new_key] = new_value
An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of [] is an empty list.

The length len() of a dictionary is the number of key-value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, even if the value is a list. 
(That’s right: you can put lists inside dictionaries!)

Instructions
1.
Add at least three more key-value pairs to the menu variable, with the dish name (as a "string") for the key and the price (a float or 
integer) as the value. Here’s an example:

py menu['Spam'] = 2.50
"""
menu = {} # Empty dictionary
menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!
menu['Hamburger'] = 8.50
menu['Pizza Slice'] = 3.50
menu['Salad'] = 10.00

print "There are " + str(len(menu)) + " items on the menu."
print menu



#12/14
"""
Changing Your Mind
Because dictionaries are mutable, they can be changed in many ways. Items can be removed from a dictionary with the del command:

del dict_name[key_name]
will remove the key key_name and its associated value from the dictionary.

A new value can be associated with a key by assigning a value to the key, like so:

dict_name[key] = new_value
Instructions
1.

Remove a Few Things
Sometimes you need to remove something from a list.

beatles = ["john","paul","george","ringo","stuart"]
beatles.remove("stuart")
print beatles
This code will print:

 ["john","paul","george","ringo"]
We create a list called beatles with 5 strings.
Then, we remove the first item from beatles that matches the string "stuart". Note that .remove(item) does not return anything.
Finally, we print out that list just to see that "stuart" was actually removed.

It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This

}
print my_dict["fish"][0]
In the example above, we created a dictionary that holds many types of values.
The key "fish" has a list, the key "cash" has an int, and the key "luck" has a string.
Finally, we print the letter "c". When we access a value in the dictionary like my_dict["fish"], we have direct access to that value
(which happens to be a list). We can access the item at index 0 in the list stored by the key "fish".
