#Now that we have a function to print the grades, let’s create another function to compute the sum of all of the test grades.
#This will be super-helpful when we need to compute the average score.
#I know what you’re thinking, “let’s just use the built-in sum function!” The built-in function would work beautifully, but 
#it would be too easy.
#Computing the sum manually involves computing a rolling sum. As you loop through the list, add the current grade to a
#variable that keeps track of the total, let’s call that variable total.
#On line 3, define a function, grades_sum, that does the following:
#Takes in a list of scores, scores
#Computes the sum of the scores
#Returns the computed sum.
#Call the newly created grades_sum function with the list of grades and print the result.

#Let’s see how the grades varied against the average. This is called computing the variance.
#A very large variance means that the students’ grades were all over the place, while a small 
#variance (relatively close to the average) means that the majority of the students had similar grades.
#On line 18, define a new function called grades_variance that accepts one argument, scores, a list.
#First, create a variable average and store the result of calling grades_average(scores).
#Next, create another variable variance and set it to zero. We will use this as a rolling sum.
#for each score in scores: Compute its squared difference: (average - score) ** 2 and add that to variance.
#Divide the total variance by the number of scores.
#Then, return that result.
#Finally, after your function code, print grades_variance(grades).
