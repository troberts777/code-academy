#But what if we wanted to generate a list according to some logic—for example, a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 50?
#Python’s answer to this is the list comprehension. List comprehensions are a powerful way to generate lists using the for/in

# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#This will create a new_list populated by the numbers one to five. If you want those numbers doubled, you could use:

#and go from there.

#Maybe we want every other element!
#List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this:
#[start:end:stride]
#Where start describes where the slice starts (inclusive), end is where it ends (exclusive), and stride describes the space
#between items in the sliced list. For example, a stride of 2 would select every other item from the original list to place in 
#the sliced list.

Anonymous Functions
One of the more powerful aspects of Python is that it allows for a style of programming called functional programming, 
which means that you’re allowed to pass functions around just as if they were variables or values. Sometimes we take this 
for granted, but not all languages allow this!
Check out the code at the right. See the lambda bit? Typing
lambda x: x % 3 == 0
Is the same as
def by_three(x):
  return x % 3 == 0
Only we don’t need to actually give the function a name; it does its work and returns a value without one. That’s why the 
function the lambda creates is an anonymous function.
When we pass the lambda to filter, filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter, and the second argument (my_list, 
which is just the numbers 0 – 15) is the list it does the filtering on.

Lambda functions are defined using the following syntax:

Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.

Fill in the first part of the filter function with a lambda. The lambda should ensure that only "Python" is returned by the filter.
Fill in the second part of the filter function with languages, the list to filter.
Remember, filter() takes two arguments: the first is the function that tells it what to filter, and the second is the object to
